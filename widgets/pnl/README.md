## Wealthica P&L % Change Widget

Wealthica widget for checking the P&L changes for well known time periods like 1D, WTD (Week To Date), MTD (Month To Date) etc.,. P&L is computed using the portfolio value against the deposits/withdrawals. This widget is an inspiration from one of the P&L chart in the [P&L Timeline addon](https://github.com/mani-coder/wealthica-addons/tree/master/addon/pnl).

Steps to load the addon:

1. Sign in into your Wealthica account
2. Under widgets in the dashboard, click on the three dots and select "Manage Widgets"
3. Select P/L % Change to the top 3 widgets
